BUGME February 2011

Mac OSX does not use multithreading, silently ignoring it so as to work. It
does not support unnamed semaphores so another synchronisation primitive will
be required (named semaphores or other).

There have been rare reports of corruption on decompression of files >20GB.
The cause remains unknown so caution is recommended, and not to use lrzip for
mission critical massive file backups. Checking files with md5sum is
recommended till further notice.
