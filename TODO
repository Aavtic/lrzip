Other posix/windows builds?? Need help there...

Add log file option so that output could be
saved for review.

Add test function that would only run lzo_compresses
for a current file without doing any writes.

Consider ncurses version or even GUI one.

Consider using LZMA Filters for processor-optimised
coding to increase compression.

Get the ASM working on 64bit.

Clean up the config system since it's a mystery to me.

Make stdout work without a temporary file.

Make stdin on decompression work without a temporary file.

Make testing file integrity work without a temporary file.

Fix darwin build since it doesn't support unnamed semamphores.

Parallelise compression further by moving into next stream while backend
threads still continue on earlier stream.
